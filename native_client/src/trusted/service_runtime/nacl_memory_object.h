   *
   * If the object ends in the middle of an allocation, the kernel
   * will zero pad the allocation.  The zero bytes are writable, but
   * are not reflected back into the file.  First, assume that the
   * file size does not change.  This means that for a shared mapping,
   * when an address space move occurs we have to re-map the file at
   * the new position, and then copy the contents of the rest of the
   * allocation to the new location.
   *
   * If the file has shrunk, then the shared portion between the new
   * end of file and the original end of file is impossible to
   * duplicate as a shared mapping -- we may need to just crash and
   * burn at that point.
   *
   * If the file has grown, then the unshared portion between the old
   * end-of-file and end of that page (assuming it has grown past the
   * page boundary) probably should not get overwritten -- and we may
   * need to crash and burn at this point as well.
   *
   * On linux, we could use mremap, but then there's no need: the race
   * condition with not being able to atomically update the memory
   * mappings doesn't exist.
