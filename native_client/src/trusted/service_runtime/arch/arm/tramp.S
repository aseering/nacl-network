 * ARM passes parameters to a callee in registers r0-r3. If there are more
 * than 4 parameters, the first four args are passed in registers the rest are
 * placed on the stack. This code pushes all parameters from registers into the
 * stack; thus, we keep all parameters on the stack as follows:
 * top - arg0, arg1, arg2, arg3 .... argN
 *
 * On top of that we push the return address, so we will know where to return
 * after the system call.
 *
 * After this code the stack layout must look like:
 *
 * sp+0: retaddr to user module
 * sp+4: arg0 (system call argument)
 * sp+8: arg1
 * ..........
 * sp+X: argN
 *
 * When service runtime serves a system call, it first creates a structure which
 * utilizes these arguments. The structure is created by Decoder functions in
 * nacl_syscall_handlers.c. (nacl_syscall_handlers.c is an automatically
 * generated file and placed in
 * scons-out//gen/native_client/src/trusted/service_runtime).
