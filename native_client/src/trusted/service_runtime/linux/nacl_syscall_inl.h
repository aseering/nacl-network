 * Syscall return value mapper.  The linux raw syscall convention is
 * that anything positive and anything smaller than a certain negative
 * number are valid return values (think addresses in the 2GB range,
 * since user addresses may be in the first 3 GB, and the kernel lives
 * in the 4th GB), and anything else (smallish negative numbers) are
 * errors from Linux (possibly OSX).  In such a case, the syscall
 * wrapper will take the negative value and store it into the
 * thread-specific errno variable, and return -1 instead.  Since we
 * are using these wrappers, we merely detect when any host OS syscall
 * returned -1, and pass -errno back to the NaCl app.  (The syscall
 * wrappers on the NaCl app side will similarly follow the
 * negative-values-are-errors convention).
