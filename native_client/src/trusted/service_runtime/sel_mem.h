 * Initially, the address space is empty, with all memory
 * inaccessible.  As the program is loaded, pages are marked
 * accessible -- text pages are non-writable, data and stack are
 * writable.  At runtime, shared memory buffers are allocated by
 * looking at the first memory hole that fits, starting down from the
 * stack.
 *
 * The simple data structure that we use is a sorted array of valid
