# This is a simple test file to see if we have things working.
# When run in self documenting mode and command free lines,
# are echoed to the output.
#
# Lines with command line options (up to and including the pound sign) are
# also copied to output. Application (ncdis) is then run on those options,
# generating corresponding output. It is assume that the text after the
# pound sign is the output generated by ncdis. Hence, this file is self
# documenting in the sense that the input matches the output.
#
# Note: Useful command line options are:
#   -i=XXXXXXXX
#           Specifies a (even length) hexidecimal value defined the sequence
#           of bytess that defines the instruction to translate.
#
#   -pc=XXXXXXXX
#           Specifies the value of the program counter, when it is pointing
#           to the instruction to be decoded. In not specified, the program
#           counter is assumed to be zero.
#
# Note: This file tests x86-32 instructions when -use_iter is specified.
