/*
 * Native Client Resource Descriptor Transfer Protocol for trusted code.
 *
 * The public API consists of a subset of the interface used
 * internally by the service runtime.  Use only the functions declared
 * in this header file, NaClDescUnref, and NaClDesc*{Ctor}.
 *
 * The intent is that trusted code have to act as a forwarding agent,
 * e.g., the browser plugin, must also implement the NRD transfer
 * protocol in order to pass objects between NaCl modules even if the
 * forwarding agent itself will not use the access rights itself.  By
 * permitting the forwarding agent to receive the data-only portion of
 * an IMC message and to receive the NRDs as separate opaque object
 * references, the forwarding agent is free to forward individual NRDs
 * embedded in an incoming message separately, hold on to them to send
 * later, etc.
