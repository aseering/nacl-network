   * interface there.  backing_desc is the NaClDesc that is providing

   *
   * For trusted application code, this can be a no-op routine (a stub
   * that does nothing; all method function pointers must be
   * non-NULL).
   *
   * Note that because windows map things in 64K granularity and in
   * order to allow independent overlapping allocations, we map the
   * object in 64K chunks at a time.  Thus, it is critical that the
   * unmapping is done via the corresponding unmap function using the
   * descriptor object that was used to create the mapping in the
   * first place, so some recording keeping is still needed for
   * trusted application code.
