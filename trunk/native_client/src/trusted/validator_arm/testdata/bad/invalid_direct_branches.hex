# Assorted tests of broken direct branches.

# Some branches doing naughty things to trampolines.  The first instruction
# in this file is at 128K, so we can reach them by short relative branches.
# Note that, as these branches are relevant, the same instruction encoding is
# used for both the valid and invalid cases.
20000:
ebfffff6  # A valid branch to the springboard's leading halt
eafffff6  # An INVALID branch to the springboard's internals!
eaffbffc  # A valid branch to trampoline 0
ebffbffc  # An INVALID branch to trampoline 0's internals!

# Some branches targeting various parts of a data bundle
eb000003  # Jump to the first data word
ea000001  # Jump to the head
